00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,079
right now

3
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:20,559
we're facing a man-made disaster

4
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:22,559
of global scale

5
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:24,239
our greatest threat in thousands of

6
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:27,118
years

7
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,118
climate change

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,159
if we don't take action

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,000
the collapse of our civilizations

10
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:38,398
and the extinction

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,009
of much of the natural world

12
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,480
is on the horizon

[Music]

14
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:49,199
the world's people have spoken

15
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:52,799
their message is clear

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,800
time is running out

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,878
the amount of carbon dioxide in the

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,480
atmosphere now is 50 higher than it was

19
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:02,799
in 1900

20
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,518
and not only are we piling in more and

21
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:07,840
more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

22
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,920
but we are chopping down the forests of

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,240
the earth at a great rate

24
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,680
and the forests themselves are the most

25
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:17,919
efficient consumers of carbon dioxide

26
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,479
that there are on earth

27
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,719
we're going to destroy the ground

28
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:25,759
because the soil of a rainforest isn't

29
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:27,519
very good we are actually tampering with

30
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,799
the climate of the earth and with the

31
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:33,519
very atmosphere that we breathe

32
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,520
when we talk about the disappearance of

33
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,679
the ozone layer

34
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:40,399
we don't know what will happen when the

35
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,520
ozone layer goes

36
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,000
the world has become so fragile

37
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:48,560
that we cannot subject the earth

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,078
to the tortures we can now inflict upon

39
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,118
it

40
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:55,438
when we talk about the greenhouse effect

41
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:58,718
we're talking about something

42
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:00,959
that affects the entire earth

43
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,078
and these problems are life and death

44
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,039
problems

45
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:08,840
they go to the root of the viability of

46
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,840
the planet itself

47
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:29,640
[Music]

48
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,000
so there's one thing that is

49
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:35,839
biologically certain

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,598
about the human species is that it is a

51
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,400
human species

52
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:42,878
one species

53
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:47,280
if we don't stop the destruction of our

54
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:47,280
natural world nothing else will matter

55
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:56,518
simply put if we don't protect nature

56
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:56,518
we can't protect ourselves

57
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,860
[Music]

58
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,640
the only way we can solve a problem

59
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:15,120
is by a human solution

60
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:17,119
never can we sit back and wait for

61
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,280
miracles to save us

62
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,959
miracles don't happen

63
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,800
sweat happens

64
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,780
efforts happens

65
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:29,139
thought happens

66
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,139
